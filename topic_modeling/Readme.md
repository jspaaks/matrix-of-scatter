Clustering data obtained as a result from the Topic Modeling group
 
AngularAndTSNE.py: using angular distance (obtained via cosine distance) and TSNE embedding. K-means with 25 clusters for clustering. The biggest cluster is actually a collection of almost-singleton clusters 

DBSCAN: same as above, but using DBSCAN for clustering

Data is avalable from Sherlock's one drive (processeddata.tar)

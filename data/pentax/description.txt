This data set was created from the images of size 4000x3000 in the Dresden image database.
The number of images in the dataset is 638.

Three different similarity metrics are used:
    NCC - Normalized Cross-Correlation
    PCE - Peak-to-Correlation Energy ratio
    PCE0- variant of PCE that does not use the real peak value


The .dat files are written with Java so to open them with Python you have tell numpy about
the big endian data, for example:
numpy.fromfile("filename.dat", dtype='>d')
